		<h2>What is Genotoxic Waste?</h2><br><br>
		<p>
			In genetics, genotoxicity describes the property of chemical agents that damages the genetic information within a cell causing mutations, which <br><br>may lead to cancer. While genotoxicity is often confused with mutagenicity, all mutagens are genotoxic, whereas not all genotoxic substances <br><br>are mutagenic. The alteration can have direct or indirect effects on the DNA: the induction of mutations, mistimed event activation, and <br><br>direct DNA damage leading to mutations. The permanent, heritable changes can affect either somatic cells of the organism or germ cells to be<br><br> passed on to future generations.[1] Cells prevent expression of the genotoxic mutation by either DNA repair or apoptosis; however, the<br><br> damage may not always be fixed leading to mutagenesis.

		As mentioned, segregation is the first step of genotoxic waste management and in this study the status of segregation was ranked as medium and poor. <br><br>This is due to the lack of knowledge and awareness in the field of genotoxic waste and its hazards as well as the lack of proper guidelines,<br><br> legislation, regulations and instructions on health care waste management and lack of a specific plan for the management of genotoxic wastes.<br><br> Since the condition of genotoxic waste management in this study was ranked as medium, therefore some steps of hospital waste management system<br><br> require improvement. So, it is concluded that by following the state regulations and providing more training to the involved staff in future, an <br><br>acceptable practice of healthcare waste management can be achieved.
