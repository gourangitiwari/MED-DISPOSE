		<h2>What is Infectious Waste?</h2><br><br>
		<p>
Infectious waste includes any fluids, solids, or materials that have the potential to carry infectious microorganisms and transfer diseases.<br><br>

The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) definition of infectious waste is:<br><br>

“Waste contaminated with blood and its by-products, cultures and stocks of infectious agents, waste from patients in isolation wards, discarded diagnostic samples containing blood and body fluids, and contaminated materials (swabs and bandages) and equipment (such as disposable medical devices).”<br><br>

Infectious waste is anything contaminated with human and/or animal:<br><br>
Blood.<br>
Bodily fluids, e.g. saliva, mucous, or pus.<br>
Waste products (faeces, urine, and vomit).<br>
Skin or tissue.<br>
These can contaminate all sorts of surfaces and materials.<br><br>

Items that pose a risk to cleaners and people in charge of waste disposal include syringes and needles, scalpel blades, plasters, bandages, soiled clothing, bedding (human and animal), toilets, materials used to clean wounds.<br><br>

	<h2>Safe Disposal of Infectious Waste</h2>
</p><p>You must wear protective gloves when handling waste.<br><br> Do not touch anything other than the infectious waste once you have put them on, and make sure you remove and dispose of them hygienically once you’re done.<br><br> Dispose of them like you would any other infectious waste unless told otherwise.<br><br>

Also, cover your body as much as possible. This is especially important if you have any open wounds (even a tiny cut on your hand could be enough for entry).<br><br> Properly dress wounds with sterile plasters or bandages.<br><br>

Cleaning contaminated surfaces<br><br>
A quick wipe down of a surface may look like it’s removed all infectious substances, but microorganisms are guaranteed to linger if it hasn’t been sterilised.<br><br>

Be sure to isolate the area, use suitable cleaning substances such as a chlorine releasing agent, bleach, hot water, and detergent, and dispose of all <br><br>materials used to remove the substance (including gloves) hygienically and safely.<br><br>

Be sure to sanitise your hands afterwards
